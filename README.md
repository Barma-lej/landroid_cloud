### Installation:

#### HACS

- Ensure that HACS is installed.
- Search for and install the "Landroid Cloud" integration.
- Restart Home Assistant.

#### Manual installation

- Download the latest release.
- Unpack the release and copy the custom_components/landroid_cloud directory into the custom_components directory of your Home Assistant installation.
- Restart Home Assistant.

### Example entry for configuration.yaml

```
landroid_cloud:
  - email: this@example.com
    password: YourPassword
```

You can add multiple accounts like in this example:

```
landroid_cloud:
  - email: this@example.com
    password: YourPassword
  - email: another@example.com
    password: AnotherPassword
```

### Entities & Services

Once installed, the following entities are created in Home Assistant:

```
sensor.landroid_[NAME_FROM_APP]_battery
sensor.landroid_[NAME_FROM_APP]_error
sensor.landroid_[NAME_FROM_APP]_status
```

In addition, the following services are created:

```
landroid_cloud.start
landroid_cloud.home
landroid_cloud.pause
landroid_cloud.configure (can be used to set rain delay and time extension)
```

You can simply add these to your Lovelace setup by adding an entity card. A recommended Lovelace layout is being considered for a future release.
